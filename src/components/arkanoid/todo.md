wormhole - paddle may disappear

after loading the game, if the first move is paddle to the left, the ball goes right instead of left

- add

  - slow ball
  - quick ball

- sticky ball

* ball at the corner of paddle - when you move the paddle to the edge of canvas and then shoot, ball goes directly upwards and shakes and cant be moved the other way. or it can just disappear outside the canvas

- solid brick
  -- ball can become stuck inside a solid brick, or run around the edge

had two balls or maybe three active, lvl4 ended too early, while modal is visible a ball is inside bricks already. lvl5 finished to early too
hit 39 inlvl 39
stages.js:63 level win
Game.jsx:60 6

ball1 doesnt change back to ball0 after powerup runs out. problem - ball1 might need to become ball0 a long time after the powerup ends. need to check for it. maybe check again on dropping ball
when wormhole stops, suddenly ball[1] and ball[2] are logged with x and vx 0

level in the input field is not updating after lvl up

shoot the ball - change to release the ball maybe
canvas should be taller
maybe the center of the paddle shouldn't be 90 degree angle but a bit skewed

- multiple balls - should disappear before drawing a new level after lvlup
- change canvas background, should be a bit lighter
- lvl6 annoyingly difficult, 4 too. need less solid bricks

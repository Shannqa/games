sticky powerup - ball moves to the most left, crash of the game but paddle moves, space doesnt release the ball
what is dark green powerup? doesnt do anything i think -- extra life, needs to be communicated
very dark blue, triple balls - 2 extra balls have same angle, when they touch the paddle there is a crash, paddle disappears, balls stop moving. ball1 moves with the paddle when it shouldnt?
double balls - second ball hits bottom canvas and doesnt disappear
2x big paddle powerup - shouldnt expand the paddle twice as much
ball should be quicker
no gun powerup
first level not even finished and have 1000 score

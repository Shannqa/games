maybe the center of the paddle shouldn't be 90 degree angle but a bit skewed

adjust ball / paddle speeds, how fast should the ball be able to go at an angle down in order to catch it by the paddle in time

wormhole doesnt get turned off even after lvlup - the graphics isn't there but you can move the paddle outside of canvas

wingame modal is too low

modal enter name - cant have a space

wingame highscore saved - player isnt notified

mobile - the ball is too quick

powerups - need to be bigger

mobile - move to the center horizontally
gameover modal - can move paddle

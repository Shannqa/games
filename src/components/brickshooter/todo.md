wormhole - paddle may disappear

after loading the game, if the first move is paddle to the left, the ball goes right instead of left

- add

  - slow ball
  - quick ball

- sticky ball

* ball at the corner of paddle - when you move the paddle to the edge of canvas and then shoot, ball goes directly upwards and shakes and cant be moved the other way. or it can just disappear outside the canvas

level in the input field is not updating after lvl up

shoot the ball - change to release the ball maybe
canvas should be taller
maybe the center of the paddle shouldn't be 90 degree angle but a bit skewed

- change canvas background, should be a bit lighter

adjust ball / paddle speeds, how fast should the ball be able to go at an angle down in order to catch it by the paddle in time
